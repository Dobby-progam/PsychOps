    <span class="fs-3">BadWolf data collection</span>
    <p>
    We collect Guild IDs (guild prefixes, guild blacklist*) and User IDs (suggestions, user blacklists*). We need to store this data for guild prefixes and guild blacklists to remain guild specific. User IDs are collected for suggestions so that we can inform a member about their suggestion status without them being in our support server. <b>Your data is not provided, sold or shared to any 3d party vendors or parties.</b>
    <br>
    * These are only gathered if a guild or user gets blacklisted on our bot, together with the respective reason.
